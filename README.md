This repository contains AUTO scripts and some printouts for the analysis presented in the SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Sysytems (2020) article:
"Big Ducks in the Heart: Canard Analysis Can Explain Large Early Afterdepolarizations in Cardiomyocytes"

- Archive_EAD_DesingLuo_dinf contains AUTO scripts for a bifurcation analysis of the desingularized reduced system as well as the .xml vector field file used to generate the AUTO C file and the .ode file
- Archive_EAD_Luo contains contains AUTO scripts for a bifurcation analysis of the full (modified, see manuscript) system
- canard0 and canard1 contain the AUTO scripts used to compute the primary strong canard (canard0, &gamma;<sub>0</sub>) and the first secondary maximal canard (canard1, &gamma;<sub>1</sub>)
